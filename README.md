# Cybersecurity News and Incident Report Writeups

This repository is a collection of my writeups/takeaways about any cybersecurity news, advisories, attacks, breaches, or notable incidents that I find interesting enough to write down. 

These are mostly just to keep myself up to date with industry happenings and have a place to make note of cybersecurity news. I intend to create reports based on all of the different sources I find while researching a topic, and will document the sources as best I can. 

I will try to create entries with "professional" formatting, or as if I was writing an actual incident report document, but in general they will likely be more informal.
