Notes:

Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in Pennsylvania has been attacked by Iranian-backed hacker group called CyberAv3ngers. The threat actors targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in their water and wastewater systems (WWS) sector. 

It was reported that the actors gained control of a remote booster station serving two townships. The water authority immediately took the system offline and switched to manual operations, and have publicly stressed that there is no known risk to its drinking water or water supply. 

The attack was a part of CyberAv3ngers' widespread attacks on Israeli water and energy sites since 10/30/23. This attack being in the U.S. may be related to the use of Unitronics PLCs because Unitronics is an Israel-based company. 

Some interesting remediation or prevention techniques listed in the CISA advisory are to: 

- Change the default password of "1111"
- Utilize a different TCP port than 20256 because threat actors have identified this as a common port for Unitronics PLCs 

These PLCs are used to control and monitor stages and processes of the WWS. Gaining control of these systems can be extremely detrimental to the water authority's overall ICS/SCADA system. Thankfully the water authority reported no risk to the water supply, but if the attackers had been successful it would have meant the water authorities inability to provide clean water and manage wastewater.
