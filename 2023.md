Description: Water and wastewater systems exploitation  
Type: Attack - ICS/SCADA  
Victim: Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa  
Time of Occurrence: 11/25/2023-Present (11/28/2023)  
Location: Aliquippa, Pennsylvania  
Threat Actors: CyberAv3ngers  

Notes:

Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in Pennsylvania has been attacked by Iranian-backed hacker group called CyberAv3ngers. The threat actors targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in their water and wastewater systems (WWS) sector. 

It was reported that the actors gained control of a remote booster station serving two townships. The water authority immediately took the system offline and switched to manual operations, and have publicly stressed that there is no known risk to its drinking water or water supply. 

The attack was a part of CyberAv3ngers' widespread attacks on Israeli water and energy sites since 10/30/23. This attack being in the U.S. may be related to the use of Unitronics PLCs because Unitronics is an Israel-based company. 

Some interesting remediation or prevention techniques listed in the CISA advisory are to: 

- Change the default password of "1111"
- Utilize a different TCP port than 20256 because threat actors have identified this as a common port for Unitronics PLCs 

These PLCs are used to control and monitor stages and processes of the WWS. Gaining control of these systems can be extremely detrimental to the water authority's overall ICS/SCADA system. Thankfully the water authority reported no risk to the water supply, but if the attackers had been successful it would have meant the water authorities inability to provide clean water and manage wastewater.

## 12/14/2023

Description: Data breach of 23andMe customer data (names, locations, relatives, etc.)
Type: Data breach caused by credential stuffing or hybrid brute force attack 
Victim: 23andMe 
Time of Occurrence: 10/1/23 - 12/1/2023
Location: Worldwide; Company does business in U.S., Canada, many European countries, and other places such as Australia and Hong Kong
Threat Actors: 1 or more hackers who made posts on BreachForums

Notes: 

The timeline on when 23andMe knew that millions of customers had been affected is, from my research, still not entirely clear. The company initially filed a report with the SEC on 10/10/2023 in response to the data breach that the threat actor posted about on BreachForums about on 10/1/2023. In this filing, the company stated that only 14,000 users (0.1% of 14 million total customers) had been affected. 

The following 12/1/2023 filing was an amendment to supplement the original filing, but there was no update to the number of affected customers. To my knowledge, the reported 6.9 million customers was not released until 12/4/2023. 

23andMe does business internationally so the company would be subject to many privacy regulations such as GDPR. The sudden jump from 14,000 to 6.9 million users over a span of 2 months could be legally problematic for the company. The 12/1/2023 filing states there are already class action claims, "in federal and state court in California... Illinois... as well as in British Columnia and Ontario, Canada". My understanding of these events leads me to think that 23andMe may be in legal trouble regarding their timeliness of notifying their customers about the breach. 

The SEC filings stated that the breach was due to customers reusing passwords which made them vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks. It is unclear how many threat actors were involved in this event but at least one of them posted on BreachForums offering account information for payment.

## 12/22/2023

Description: Data breach of Comcast Xfinity customer data (usernames and hashed passwords, names, contact information, last for digits of social security number, dates of birth, security questions and answers)
Type: Data breach caused by CitrixBleed vulnerability (CVE-2023-496); Buffer overflow
Victim: Comcast Xfinity 
Time of Occurrence: August 2023 - Present (12/22/2023)
Location: United states; 50,782 customers in Maine, 35,879,455 total 
Threat actors: LockBit, Medusa, and at least 2 other ransomware groups 

Notes:

CitrixBleed (CVE-2023-4966) is a 7.5 score vulnerability that affects Citrix Netscaler Gateway and ADC products. Citrix Netscaler is a network device for load balancing, firewall, and VPN services. NetScaler Gateway refers to the VPN and authentication while ADC refers to the load balancing and traffic management features. 

This is a vulnerability that is documented as an information disclosure vulnerability that is caused by buffer overflow exploits. In practice, the buffer overflow techniques are as simple as sending a request over 24,812 bytes to an unpatched NetScaler device. This will then cause a memory leak that can result in exposed session tokens of people logged in to the NetScaler device. Threat actors can use these session tokens to hijack a live authenticated session. 

An [example exploit](https://github.com/assetnote/exploits/blob/main/citrix/CVE-2023-4966/exploit.py) posted by AssetNote shows the simplicity of the overflow technique by sending a request with an overflowing string of a's: 

```python
headers = {
    "Host": "a"*24576
}
r = requests.get(f"https://{hostname}/oauth/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration", headers=headers, verify=False,timeout=10)
```

Chris Morgain, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest, has stated that even if organizations patch this exploit, session tokens can be accessed from a device's memory which can still be used to hijack sessions. 

Based on this info, the [recommended actions](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4966) by NIST are to apply any patches that Comcast has released and to kill any active sessions. Cloud Software Group has provided example commands to kill these sessions: 

- `kill icaconnection -all`
- `kill rdp connection -all`
- `kill pcoipConnection -all`
- `kill aaa session -all`
- `clear lb persistentSessions`

These types of exploits against Citrix have been ongoing since August 2023, and based on a [filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/49e711c6-e27c-4340-867c-9a529ab3ca2c.shtml) as of 12/18/2023 there have been 35,879,455 affected customers. Comcast has notified customers on 12/05/2023 and 12/18/2023, and customers have been forced to change their passwords along with being strongly encouraged to enable MFA.
