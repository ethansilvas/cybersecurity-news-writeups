Notes:

Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in Pennsylvania has been attacked by Iranian-backed hacker group called CyberAv3ngers. The threat actors targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in their water and wastewater systems (WWS) sector. It was reported that the actors gained control of a remote booster station serving two townships. The water authority immediately took the system offline and switched to manual operations, and have publicly stressed that there is no known risk to its drinking water or water supply. 

The attack was a part of CyberAv3ngers' widespread attacks on Israeli water and energy sites since 10/30/23.
