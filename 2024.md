Description: Operation Triangulation - iPhone/iOS memory restriction bypass 
Type: Vulnerability  
Victim: iOS versions up to iOS 16.2; Russian diplomats and officials  
Time of Occurrence: 2019 - Present 
Location: Worldwide 
Threat Actors: APTs 

Notes: 

Operation Triangulation is a complex string of iOS zero-days that ultimately try to bypass hardware memory protection so that spyware can be placed on the device. What makes these attacks very interesting is the targets, typically Russian officials and a Russian cybersecurity company named Kaspersky. This has led Russia's federal security service (FSB) to claim the vulnerabilities to be a part of a larger U.S. spy plot that involves targeting Russian allies like Israel, Syria, and China. 

Apple has denied these claims and the only evidence that Russia seems to be using in public statements is the fact that Apple is an American company. The NSA and all of the previously mentioned countries have not responded to the Russian allegations. 

What makes Operation Triangulation so complex is that it involves the exploitation of many vulnerabilities in order for spyware payload to reach its destination. However, the initial exploitation seems to have consistently been through attackers sending an iMessage attachment that allows for remote code execution ([CVE-2023-41990](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213842)). This will then lead to a long chain of different vulnerability exploitations, some of which include: 

- Targeting the ADJUST TrueType font instruction exclusive to Apple
- Manipulate the JavaScriptCore library with NSExpression/NSpredicate query languages
- Exploits JavaScriptCore's debugging feature $vm
- Exploiting an integer overflow vulnerability in XNU's memory mapping syscalls ([CVE-2023-32434](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32434))
- Bypass the Page Protection Layer (PPL) ([CVE-2023-38606](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38606)) 
- Injecting a payload that clears any exploitation traces by initiating the IMAgent process
- Use an invisible Safari process that uses a web page to perform victim verification which then triggers [CVE-2023-32435](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32435) 
- Another kernel exploit in a Mach object file then uses [CVE-2023-32434](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32434) and [CVE-2023-38606](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38606)
- Then, finally, the attacker will have root privileges which then after a few more steps will lead to the spyware being installed

Kaspersky is the main source of documentation on Operation Triangulation and notes that the reason these vulnerabilities are so difficult to track is because many of the affected iOS features being targeted are undocumented. Therefore, the only way to detect these steps is through advanced network traffic analysis and forensic analysis of backups from affected devices. Kaspersky has also said that even macOS systems have the ability to be protected against these attacks with endpoint detection and response systems because the OS is more open. 

It has been stated that these attacks work up to iOS version 16.2, for now at least, but iOS 17 has been out since September 2023. Given that the reported targets are Kaspersky employees and Russian officials, this could mean that both are still using iOS 16 for their corporate/government employee devices.  

Some remediation steps listed by Kaspersky are to implement EDR systems, disable iMessage and Facetime, and promptly install iOS updates.

## 1/12/2024

Description: Microsoft SharePoint server privilege escalation exploit   
Type: Vulnerability and known exploit  
Victim: Unknown
Time of Occurrence: March 2023 - Present 
Location: Worldwide
Threat Actors: Ransomware groups

Notes: 

CISA has rated a Microsoft SharePoint server privilege escalation exploit a 9.8/10.0 on the CVSS scale, and it continues to be a known exploit despite Microsoft issuing a patch for it in June 2023. The exploit allows threat actors to bypass authentication and gain admin access to a server with spoofed JWT tokens. 

Security researchers first found this exploit in March 2023 as a remote code execution exploit chain. The chain starts with the authentication bypass [CVE-2023-29357](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29357) then leads to the attackers having remote access to execute arbitrary code on a SharePoint 2019, 2016, or Subscription Edition server [CVE-2023-24955](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24955). The researchers who found this exploit chain, [STAR Labs](https://starlabs.sg/), initially revealed it in March 2023's Pwn2Own Vancouver event. They released a [technical paper](https://starlabs.sg/blog/2023/09-sharepoint-pre-auth-rce-chain/) detailing the two attack methods: 

1. JWT spoofing - An unauthenticated user can spoof a valid JWT using the none signing algorithm, which means that the payload is not cryptographically signed so signature validation isn't checked. 
2. Remote code execution - "A SharePoint user with `Sharepoint Owners` permission can inject arbitrary code by replacing `/BusinessDataMetadataCatalog/BDCMetadata.bdcm`" in the root directory of the web page which will then get compiled and executed by SharePoint. 

Nguyễn Tiến Giang (Jang), the StarLab member who worked on the exploits, has emphasized that the remote code execution is significantly harder because the initial authentication bypass will only give attackers access to the SharePoint API, which is very difficult to insert arbitrary code into.

Inserting the arbitrary code is very complicated but for a basic summary the attacker can take advantage of this method in the API: 

```csharp
//Microsoft.SharePoint.BusinessData.SystemSpecific.WebService.DynamicProxyGenerator
public virtual Assembly GenerateProxyAssembly(DiscoveryClientDocumentCollection serviceDescriptionDocuments, string proxyNamespaceName, string assemblyPathAndName, string protocolName, out string sourceCode)
{
  //...
  CodeNamespace codeNamespace = new CodeNamespace(proxyNamespaceName); // [17]
  //...
  CodeCompileUnit codeCompileUnit = new CodeCompileUnit();
  codeCompileUnit.Namespaces.Add(codeNamespace); // [18]
  codeCompileUnit.ReferencedAssemblies.Add("System.dll");
  //...
  CodeDomProvider codeDomProvider = CodeDomProvider.CreateProvider("CSharp");
  StringCollection stringCollection = null;
  //...
  using (TextWriter textWriter = new StringWriter(new StringBuilder(), CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
  {
    CodeGeneratorOptions codeGeneratorOptions = new CodeGeneratorOptions();
    codeDomProvider.GenerateCodeFromCompileUnit(codeCompileUnit, textWriter, codeGeneratorOptions);
    textWriter.Flush();
    sourceCode = textWriter.ToString(); // [19]
  }
  CompilerResults compilerResults = codeDomProvider.CompileAssemblyFromDom(compilerParameters, new CodeCompileUnit[] { codeCompileUnit }); // [20]
  //...
}
```

The goal is to insert your payload of code into the `proxyNamespaceName` parameter because there is not any validation performed on it. The code inserted into this parameter is then added to the `codeCompileUnit.Namespaces` object which holds all of the code to later be compiled and executed. 

Unfortunately, as of the time of this writeup, I could not find any information about companies affected by this exploit as there are only some mentions of people claiming that ransomware groups are currently using it. However, due to the criticality of the vulnerability it is now subject to the Binding Operational Directive ([BOD 22-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities)) which means that it poses a significant risk to federal systems. BOD 22-01 requires that FCEB agencies respond to these vulnerabilities by integrating them into their internal vulnerability management procedures within 60 days of issuance.
